# Random Quote Machine #
Random quote machine will generate new quote when clicking "New Quote" button. It also random background image of the page. You can share the quote through twitter by clicking tweet icon. It will navigate to your twitter if you already login and automatically fill out the text box.

## Issues ##
* There are some bugs that I can figure out the problem. If you want to view the app you can view in [My CodePen](https://codepen.io/so4more/pen/rZZjKd) in editor view. It has a problem on displaying in Full Page mode.
* When open index.html in the browser, it does not display anything and it does not log any error, so I cannot figure the problem.
